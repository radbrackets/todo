### Project todos

We would like to create simple todo list app in flutter

### Requirements

* User registration and login: Users should be able to create an account with a unique username and password to access their todo lists.
* Create new todos: Users should be able to create new todos with a title, description, due date, and priority level.
* Edit existing todos: Users should be able to edit the title, description, due date, and priority level of existing todos.
* Mark todos as complete: Users should be able to mark a todo as complete and remove it from their active todo list.
* View all todos: Users should be able to view all of their todos, regardless of completion status, in a list or grid view.
* Set reminders: Users should be able to set reminders for specific todos, which will trigger a notification at the specified time.
* Dark mode: The app should support a dark mode theme for users who prefer a darker color scheme.
* Sync with cloud: The app should allow users to sync their todo lists with the cloud, so they can access their lists on multiple devices.

#### What we care for:
- Quality of tests
- Clean code

#### What we expect from solution:
- Treat it like production code. Develop your software in the same way that you would for any code that is intended to be deployed to production.
- Would be good to describe decision you make so future developers won't be scratching the head about the reasoning.
- Test should be green
- Code should be on github repo.
